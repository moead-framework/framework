The **Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D)** is a general-purpose algorithm 
for approximating the Pareto set of multi-objective optimization problems. It decomposes the original 
multi-objective problem into a number of 
single-objective optimization sub-problems and then uses an evolutionary process to optimize these 
sub-problems simultaneously and cooperatively. **MOEA/D** is a state-of-art algorithm in aggregation-based 
approaches for multi-objective optimization.

The goal of the *moead-framework* python package is to provide a modular framework for scientists and 
researchers interested in experimenting with **MOEA/D** and its numerous variants.
